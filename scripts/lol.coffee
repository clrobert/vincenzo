    "The power of one man doesn't amount to much. But, with whatever little strength I'm capable of... I'll do everything humanly possible to protect the people I love, and in turn they'll protect the ones they love. It seems like the least we tiny humans can do for each other.",

    "Can you really hold the woman you love, with your blood stained hands?",
    "This is hard, he's such a small target",
    "That's a stupid question, Havoc. I say it because it's true. And when I'm FÃ¼hrer, there will be changes. That day, all female officers will be required to wear...TINY MINISKIRTS!",
    "Dogs huh...I LOVE DOGS! But of course! Dogs embody loyalty, they follow their masters commands above all else! Be a jerk to them and they don't complain, and they never once beg for a paycheck! Trust me Fuery! They're the great servants of man! *sings* Boy oh canine, how we salute thee!",
    "I don't know how long you've lived fuhrer, or how many times you've cheated death, but not anymore.",
    "It's much harder dealing with the living. Give me a ghost to talk to any day.",
    "It's the end of the line.",
    "What are you doing to my dear subordinate? Don't do anything rash, Lieutenant. I told you I was going to take care of them.,
    "Men should be able to handle both their job and their women,I do.",
    "Let's test their luck.",
    "Take it or GO HOME!",
    "Way to bring your trouble home with you, Fullmetal, really nice.",
    "Nothing's perfect, the world's not perfect, but it's there for us, trying the best it can. That's what makes it so damn beautiful.",
    "(to Hawkeye at Hughes' funeral) Except... it's a terrible day for rain. Hawkeye: But, what do you mean? It's not raining. Mustang: Yes... it is. (as a single tear rolls down his cheek)",
    "I didn't do this for politics! I couldn't forgive myself for being blind this long. This is the only way I could atone for the friends I didn't saved!",
    "Foolish enough to let you prosper on their suffering.",
    "But you're thinking on too large a scale there, kid...if we don't want to drive ourselves crazy..we can only deal with what's directly in front of us.",

    "If you believe the possibility exists, then you should do whatever it takes",
    "Hmm. There really is nothing quite like watching fools dig their own graves. Especially, when that fool is an arrogant homunculus who's too stupid to see what he's doing. I've humored you long enough. So how about you answer a question of mine? I want you to tell me who killed Maes Hughes. And I want the truth, Homunculus.",
    "Quit running your mouth, you idiot! I'm sick of you homunculi giving me the runaround when I ask you this question. Tell me the truth or I'll burn it out of you! You worthless scum! Tell me who's responsible for his murder.",
    "You're saying you killed Hughes? I doubt a moron like you could pull that off.",
    "It's Kind of interesting how quickly the tongue can be rendered to a bubbling grease. It's surprising how easy it burns, isn't it?",
    "What's it like having the fluids inside of your eyes boil? I'd imagine it might sting a little.",
    "I'm surprised you'd intentionally make my target bigger for me. Did you think being bigger would let you beat me? Idiot! Get up, monster! Hurry and regenerate yourself. I'm going to let you relive that pain over and over until you die.",
    "Maes Hughes is dead. That's fact. And you to invoke his image, you must be a glutton for punishment!",
    "You fool. Did you think I wouldn't use heavy firepower right next to me? Don't you know I can do pinpoint aiming? Too bad for you, BECAUSE I CAN!!!"
